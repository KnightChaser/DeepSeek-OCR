## Executive Compensation Highlights  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[45, 42, 972, 134]]<|/det|>
Our executive compensation program is designed to reward performance. We use compensation elements that align our NEOs' interests with those of stockholders to drive long- term value. Our NEOs' compensation is heavily weighted toward performance- based, "at- risk" variable cash and long- term equity awards, which are earned only if the Company achieves pre- established financial metrics, with caps on maximum payouts. In recent years, over \(90\%\) of our CEO's and over \(45\%\) of our other NEOs' target pay has been performance- based and at- risk. Additionally, \(100\%\) of our CEO's equity awards have been granted as PSUs.

For Fiscal 2025, in recognition of the increased complexity and scope of executives' roles and responsibilities, the CC increased target equity opportunities for all NEOs. The CC also increased our CEO's base salary and target variable cash opportunity for the first time in years to align with peers and ensure internal pay equity with the base salaries of other NEOs, and shifted the mix of performance- based equity towards MY PSUs for our NEOs (excluding our CEO) to give more weight to long- term performance incentives. To motivate executives, the CC set certain Base Compensation Plan goals significantly above strong Fiscal 2024 results and Threshold goals well above our Fiscal 2024 Stretch Compensation Plan.

## Financial Performance and Link to Executive Pay  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[45, 262, 972, 310]]<|/det|>
As described in CD&A, a significant portion of our executive pay opportunities are tied to the achievement of financial measures that drive business value and contribute to our long- term success. The table below shows our goals for the applicable periods that were completed at the end of Fiscal 2025 and their impact on our executive pay.

## Ratification of Selection of PwC as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2026 (Proposal 3)  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[45, 700, 972, 790]]<|/det|>
While not required, we are asking our stockholders to ratify the AC's selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2026, as we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders do not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider the appointment, but may nevertheless retain PwC. Even if the selection is ratified, the AC may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders. The Board recommends that you vote FOR Proposal 3.

## Amend and Restate Charter to Remove All Supermajority Provisions (Proposal 4)  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[45, 829, 972, 968]]<|/det|>
At the 2024 Meeting, our stockholders approved a non- binding stockholder proposal requesting the Board to take steps to remove supermajority voting provisions in our Charter and Bylaws. Following deliberation and engagement with stockholders, the Board approved, adopted and declared advisable an amendment and restatement of our Charter to remove the remaining supermajority voting provisions, remove inoperative provisions related to a previously effected forward stock split and the completed declassification of our Board, and implement other non- substantive clarifying changes, subject to stockholder approval. The full text of the Proposed Charter is included in Appendix A to this proxy statement, with proposed new text underlined and proposed deletions crossed out. Additionally, the Board plans to approve conforming amendments to NVIDIA's Bylaws, contingent on stockholder approval of this Proposal 4. The Board recommends that you vote FOR Proposal 4.
